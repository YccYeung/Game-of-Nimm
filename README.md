1. The game starts with one or more heaps of stones between the two or more players 
2. The players alternate turns 
3. On a given turn, a player may take any number of stones from the any heap 
4. The players continue until all of the heaps have run out of stones. 
5. The game starts over and repeats until the user ends the game.
